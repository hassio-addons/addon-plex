Your recorded media, live TV, online news, and podcasts, beautifully organized
and ready to stream.

## About

The plex add-on brings your favorite media together in one place, making it
beautiful and easy to enjoy. The Plex Media Server provided by this addon,
organizes your personal video, music, and photo collections
and streams them to all of your devices.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install the "Plex Media Server" add-on.
1. Surf to <https://www.plex.tv/claim> and get your claim token.
1. Update the add-on config with the claim code you've got in the previous step.
1. Save the add-on configuration.
1. Start the "Plex Media Server" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Plex Media Server" to see if everything went well.
1. Login to the Plex admin interface and complete the setup process.

**NOTE**: Do not add this repository to Hass.io, please use:
`https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository`.

**NOTE**: When adding media locations, please use `/share` as the base
directory.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```json
{
  "log_level": "info",
  "claim_code": "claim-cAMrqFrenckFU4x445Tn",
  "webtools": true
}
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `claim_code`

To allow your server to sign-in to your Plex account, it needs a so-called
"Claim Code". Sign-ing into Plex allows Plex to locate and connect to
your server and unlocks all kinds of features as well.

In order to get your code surf to <https://www.plex.tv/claim>.

This code is only used once by the add-on. As soon as the
server is successfully authenticated with Plex, the code may be removed.

### Option: `webtools`

[WebTools][webtools] is a plug-in that contains a collection of tools
for the Plex Media Server.

Some of the tools:

- Manage Subs (Subtitles)
- Logs (PMS)
- UAS (Unsupported App Store)
- FindMedia
- PlayLists
- TechInfo

The plugin also allows you to add and install custom plugins.

Set this variable to `true` to enable it.

## Solving connection issues with Plex

Plex is pretty straightforward and pretty easy to set up. Most of the
settings are detected automatically. Nevertheless, it fails to recognize
its IP on your home network. This may cause connection issues with some
Plex apps, e.g., the Samsung Tizen Plex app.

This is not Plex its fault but is because of the Docker ecosystem, in
which this add-on runs. Luckily, there is an option in Plex to help
with that, but it is a little hidden.

- Login to the Plex web interface.
- Goto setting.
- Click the server tab.
- On the left side, choose "Network".
- Be sure you are looking at the advanced view.
  There is a button "Show Advanced" in the top right.
- Add your custom URLs to "Custom server access URLs" field.

The custom URLs are additional URLs Plex clients will use to try to connect
to Plex. You can list multiple if you'd like, separated by a comma.

Example:

```txt
http://hassio.local:32400,http://192.168.1.88:32400,http://mydomain.duckdns.org:32400
```

## AirSonos add-on conflicts

Plex Media server uses port `1900` for access to the Plex DLNA Server. This port
is also used by the AirSonos add-on.

In case they conflict, the Plex Media Server add-on will fail to start.
The following error message is shown in the Hass.io system log:

```txt
[hassio.docker] Can't start addon_40817795_plex: 500 Server Error:
Internal Server Error ("driver failed programming external connectivity
on endpoint addon_40817795_plex):
Error starting userland proxy: listen udp 0.0.0.0:1900:
bind: address already in use
```

You have two choices:

- Disable or remove the AirSonos add-on
- Change the port number 1900 to something else.

The last option will cause you to lose the DLNA capabilities of the
Plex Media Server.

## Known issues and limitations

- This add-on does support ARM-based devices, nevertheless, they must
  at least be an ARMv7 device. (Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero is not supported).
- This add-on will be able to run on a Raspberry Pi. While it still can be
  useful, don't expect too much. In general, the Pi lacks the processing power
  and is probably not able to stream your media; therefore it is not
  recommended using this add-on on such a device.
- This add-on cannot add/mount any additional USB or other devices for you.
  This is a Hass.io limitation. In case you'd like to use extra devices,
  you'll have to modify the host system yourself and is not supported by the
  Hass.io or Community add-ons team.
- A Plex Pass gives you exclusive access to new features, which are
  available through a Beta version channel of the media server. At this
  time, running this "Beta" version, is not supported by this add-on.
